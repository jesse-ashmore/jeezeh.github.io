This is the first in a pair of entries covering my move from Spotify to Apple Music.

**In this entry**, I detail my process for music discovery and curation and reflect on what music as a hobby means to me.

In the next, I cover my journey of moving from Spotify to Apple Music as a primarily non-Apple user, documenting each hurdle and workaround along the way.

<!-- Drop caps please -->

Music has been a fundamental constant in my life, but the way I've enjoyed the hobby has changed throughout the years. In my early childhood, I listened to a mix of my parents' collections: _AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen, Electric Light Orchestra, Macy Gray_; soon, though, I started forming my own tastes and interests informed heavily by movies, TV, games, and radio of that time. It was around this time when I started collecting music I enjoyed, and seeking out entirely _new_ music. These were the first sparks of _music curation_, a process that would enshrine itself in my daily life for the next 20 years.

## Discovery and curation

In my late childhood and early tweens, I filled spindles of CD-Rs with low-res MP3s, downloading as many as I could within my [50MB daily limit](https://web.archive.org/web/20100410163535/http://www.vodafone.ie/vlive/internetmobile), or until I ran out of patience; these were the 2G days, where a single MP3 could take upwards of 15 minutes to download.

In my teens, YouTube and streaming began to take hold, and _Spotify Free_ finally launched in Ireland in [late 2012](https://irishtechnews.ie/spotify-goes-live-in-ireland/).

<!-- Aside with quote? -->

Suddenly, the act of finding and acquiring music became automatic, with Spotify granting instant access to a practically infinite backlog (_and new releases_) of every genre imaginable. No longer was a single song or album getting weeks of airtime; songs would play back-to-back, and those essential favourites of my teenage years would enter my life, [permanently shaping my attitudes, emotions, and memories around it](https://archive.is/poojo). This was far too much content for CD-Rs, I needed something fast and flexible.

Enter the playlist.

## The playlist

My playlisting habits were simple at first: just click the `⭐️` beside a song I liked, and it would go straight into my _Starred_ list in Spotify.

After a few years, though, this single list started to bend and buckle, especially as my listening increased. So, I started to batching my favorites by year, creating separate `Stared YYYY` playlists at the beginning of each year for my collection to start anew. This was mostly an exercise in partitioning, with smaller playlists being easier to search and whose offline copy would take up lest storage.

Fast forward nearly a decade, and I still batch my song by year, but now I also sort any relevant songs into categories of various <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0">'tags'<span class="tooltiptext fade-in-right"><b>It's a crime that music tagging is not the default way to build music collections.</b> Imagine if you could tag a song like `favourite`, `workout`, `great bassline`, etc. and build playlists and queues based on combinations of these!</span></span>, such as by activity, emotion, instrumentation, and more.

Suffice it to say, my process has always been hands-on, and I'm willing to invest more time than the average person into organizing and shaping my music library.

## Intentionality in listening

From a curation perspective, Spotify is great for me. My weekly ritual of funneling _Discover Weekly_ and _Release Radar_ favourites into my collection has left me with a rich and eclectic mix of music for all occasions. But Spotify is a playlist-first platform, and today as I reflect on what the _process of music listening means to me_, I find myself increasingly alienated by Spotify's pursuit of the algorithmic experience over a self-directed one.

Recommended playlists, daily mixes, AI DJs, and more all fight for my attention, trying to pull me away from control and organization, and towards an endless stream and commodification of beats and vibes. I've also found myself with a [growing collection of physical media](https://www.discogs.com/user/JesseAsh/collection) over the last few years. Playlists are still the backbone of my listening and discovery process, but I've started to rediscover the joy and peace in picking a single album (physical or digital) and listening from start to end.

This more recent shift towards intentionality has left me thinking more about how and from where I get my music. Mounting negative sentiment around Spotify for its low artist pay-outs, its CEO's investments, a AI-heavy product direction have driven some of my favourite artists to pull their music. Of course, this is an inconvenience to me, but that's the point: if they can risk their livlihood for a cause, then surely I can make a small sacrifice of convenience for the same. Besides, if I want to continue supporting them through streaming revenue, at least, I'm going to have to listen elsewhere.

Coincidentally, my Spotify Family was also going through a Spotify Divorce, so **it was finally time to look for an alternative to Spotify**.

## Finding an alternative to Spotify

We are not poor for [music streaming services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services#Currently_active_services) in 2025, making the act of picking my next a little trickier. On-paper comparisons wouldn't tell the full story, either, but having a set of <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0">criteria<span class="tooltiptext">I'm willing to compromise a bit on some of these. For example, Spotify generally meets these quite well, especially points 3 and 4. This is what kept me on the platform for so long.</span></span> to narrow down the choices helps. The next platform would need to:

1. Support my process of music discovery and curation
2. Align with my own values and those of the artists I care about
3. Have a large catalog so as to not lose the deeper cuts as I migrated my library
4. Integrate well with all the ways I listen to music

### How I listen

<aside>
If you're thinking that having a device ecosystem spanning Linux, Windows, Android and Mac OS might make this difficult, you're right.
</aside>

Away from home, my listening habits are fairly regular: I listen to music on my phone during my commute, and on my work laptop at the office. At home, however, things get a little more _involved_.

Depending on the room and activity, I might be listening on my PC while playing games, my MacBook Air while doing things like writing this post, or on my home audio system (including a Linux server as a network streamer/player) for more focused listening.

Based on my criteria, I landed on two platforms I was interested in trying: **Apple Music**—which [a good friend](https://maciej.ie/) had recently migrated to and has sung its praises for—and **Qobuz**.

### Queue-buzz? Co-booze? Qobuz!

> I would end up spending relatively little time with Qobuz before moving to Apple Music.

[Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com) is interesting: branded as an audiophile streaming platform that promotes music ownership as a first-class citizen, I signed up for the trial. Things were good, until I found it lacked playlist folders. I have a lot of playlists, and organizing them by category is important to me, so having to settle for all playlists sitting in an endless list felt like a difficult pill to swallow.

[Until recently](https://community.qobuz.com/press-en/qobuz-unveils-its-new-discover-page), Qobuz also lacked in the discovery department, with no clear analogy to Spotify's Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists. These two main inconveniences were enough to push me away from Qobuz _for the time being_.

#### Right product, wrong time (for me)

In hindsight—and with the recently-added "Release watch" feature—my frustrations with Qobuz would pale in comparison to what Apple Music had in store for me, and I think had I started with Qobuz again today, I might still be there.

Their app experience was robust, lossless playback as a priority is neat, inclusion of a duo plan for couples makes it a financially attractive service, and the best royalty rates for artists out of any other platform make it stand out as a likely long-term winner in the streaming space. It's the service to keep an eye on, and something I'll return to if Apple drastically changes its product strategy.

### Apple Music

For whatever reason, I had assumed Apple Music was only available as a MacOS and iOS app, so I was was surprised to find that not only had they released a fresh Apple Music app for Windows and Android, but they were also _quite good_. I would also soon discover some pretty powerful ideas in Apple's approach to music organization that would pique my interest and keep me powering through everything it would throw at me.

With the 3 month trial that came with my MacBook Air, there was little to lose by it trying out. **Fortunately, my time and sanity are worthless.**
