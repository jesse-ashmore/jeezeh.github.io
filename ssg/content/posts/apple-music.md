**In this entry, I reflect on what music listening and curation means to me, and journal my experiences with moving from Spotify to Apple Music**, documenting every sharp edge, incompatibility, and workaround I've discovered on the way.

---

<!-- Drop caps please -->

Music has been a fundamental constant in my life, but the way I've enjoyed the hobby has changed throughout the years. In my early childhood, I listened to a mix of my parents' collections. Soon, though, I started forming my own tastes and interested, informed heavily by movies, TV, games, and radio of that time. This is also around the time when I started _curating_ and collecting music, a process that would enshrine itself in my daily life for the next 20 years.

In my late childhood and early tweens, I filled spindles of CD-Rs with low-bitrate MP3s, downloading as many as I could within my [50MB daily limit](https://web.archive.org/web/20100410163535/http://www.vodafone.ie/vlive/internetmobile), or until I ran out of patience; these were the 2G days, where a single 3MB MP3 could take upwards of 15 minutes to download. In my teens, YouTube and streaming began to take hold, and _Spotify Free_ finally launched in Ireland in [late 2012](https://irishtechnews.ie/spotify-goes-live-in-ireland/). Enter the _playlist_.

## Spotify: discovery and curation

<!-- Aside with quote? -->

Suddenly, the act of finding and acquiring music became automatic, with Spotify granting instant access to a practically infinite backlog (_and new releases_) of every genre imaginable. No longer was a single song or album getting weeks of airtime; songs would play back-to-back, and those essential favourites of my teenage years would enter my life, [permanently shaping my attitudes, emotions, and memories around it](https://archive.is/poojo). This was far too much content for CD-Rs, I needed something fast and flexible. Enter the playlist.

My playlisting habits were simple at first, just click the ⭐️ beside a song I liked, and it would go straight into my _Starred_ list in Spotify. After a few years, though, this single list started to bend and buckle, especially as my listening increased. So, I started to batching my favorites by year, creating separate `Stared YYYY` playlists at the beginning of each year for my collection to start anew. This was mostly an exercise in partitioning, with smaller playlists being easier to search and whose offline copy would take up lest storage. Fast forward nearly a decade, and I still batch my song by year, but now I also sort any relevant songs into categories of various <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0">'tags'<span class="tooltiptext fade-in-right"><b>It's a crime that music tagging is not the default way to build music collections.</b> Imagine if you could tag a song like `favourite`, `workout`, `great bassline`, etc. and build playlists and queues based on combinations of these!</span></span>, such as by activity, emotion, instrumentation, and more. Suffice it to say, my process has always been hands-on, and I'm willing to invest more time than the average person into organizing and shaping my music library.

## Intentionality in listening

From a curation perspective, Spotify is great for me. My weekly ritual of funneling _Discover Weekly_ and _Release Radar_ favourites into my collection has left me with a rich and eclectic mix of music for all occasions. But Spotify is a playlist-first platform, and today as I reflect on what the _process of music listening means to me_, I find myself increasingly alienated by Spotify's pursuit of the algorithmic experience over a self-directed one. Recommended playlists, daily mixes, AI DJs, and more all fight for my attention, trying to pull me away from control and organization, and towards an endless stream and commodification of beats and vibes. I've also found myself with a [growing collection of physical media](https://www.discogs.com/user/JesseAsh/collection) over the last few years. Playlists are still the backbone of my listening and discovery process, but I've started to rediscover the joy and peace in picking a single album (physical or digital) and listening from start to end.

This more recent shift towards intentionality has left me thinking more about how and from where I get my music. Mounting negative sentiment around Spotify for its low artist pay-outs, its CEO's investments, a AI-heavy product direction have driven some of my favourite artists to pull their music. Of course, this is an inconvenience to me, but that's the point: if they can risk their livlihood for a cause, then surely I can make a small sacrifice of convenience for the same. Besides, if I want to continue supporting them through streaming revenue, at least, I'm going to have to listen elsewhere.

Coincidentally, my Spotify Family was also going through a Spotify Divorce, so it was finally time to look for an alternative to Spotify.

## Finding an alternative to Spotify

We are not poor for music streaming platforms, there's almost _too many_ to choose from, but I had some <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0">criteria<span class="tooltiptext">I'm willing to compromise a bit on some of these. For example, Spotify generally meets these quite well, especially points 3 and 4. This is what kept me on the platform for so long.</span></span> to help guide my search. The next platform would need to:

1. Support my process of music discovery and curation
2. Align with my own values and those of the artists I care about
3. Have a large catalog so as to not lose the deeper cuts as I migrated my library
4. Integrate well with all the ways I listen to music

If you're thinking that having a device ecosystem spanning Linux, Windows, Android and Mac OS might make this difficult, you're right.
</aside>

Unsurprisingly, I listen to music on my phone during my commute, and on my work device at the office. At home, things get a little more involved depending on the room and activity. I might be listening on my PC while playing games, my MacBook Air while doing things like writing this post, or on my home audio system (including a Linux server as a network streamer/player) for more focused listening.

- Audiolab a6000 (amplifier)
- MiniDSP Flex (room correction for all inputs)
- Shanling CR60 (CD player/transport and ripper for archiving)
- HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Mini (home server) -->

Based on my criteria, I landed on two platforms I was interested in trying: **Apple Music**—which [a good friend](https://maciej.ie/) had recently migrated to and has sung its praises for—and **Qobuz**.

I would end up spending relatively little time with Qobuz before moving to Apple Music.

### Queue-buzz? Co-booze? Qobuz!

Qobuz is interesting: branded as an audiophile streaming platform that promotes music ownership as a first-class citizen, I signed up for the trial. Things were good, until I found it lacked playlist folders. I have a lot of playlists, and organizing them by category is important to me, so having to settle for all playlists sitting in an endless list felt like a difficult pill to swallow. [Until recently](https://community.qobuz.com/press-en/qobuz-unveils-its-new-discover-page), Qobuz also lacked in the discovery department, with no clear analogy to Spotify's Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists. These two main inconveniences were enough to push me away from Qobuz _for the time being_.

In hindsight, and with the recently-added "Release watch" feature, my frustrations with Qobuz would **pale in comparison** to what Apple Music had in store for me. Before we move onto Apple Music, though, I do want to highlight Qobuz's potential to be a top-tier platform. The app experience was robust, lossless playback as a priority, inclusion of a duo plan for couples, and the best royalty rates for artists out of any other platform make Qobuz stand out as a strong contender, and something I will return to if Apple Music fails to ~~keep me hostage~~ win me over in the next few months.

## Apple Music

Feeling a little disheartened from my initial Qobuz experience, I decided to research Apple Music. For whatever reason, I had assumed Apple Music was only available as a MacOS and iOS app, so I was was shocked to find that not only had they released a fresh Apple Music app for Windows, they also have an Android App, and _it's very good_.

With the 3 month trial that came with my MacBook Air, there was little to lose by it trying out. **Fortunately, my time and sanity are worthless**.

## A great first impression

Apple is generous enough to provide free access to Songshift, a playlist transfer service, for users moving to Apple Music. Within a few minutes I kicked off the process to move all my playlists, and by the next time I remembered to check on the app it had completed. Given some playlists had thousands of songs, the speed and accuracy of the migration was impressive. Although it didn't copy my folder structure it only took a few minutes of to create them by hand and get back to the same point I left from with Spotify.

This was a great first impression, and it would continue from there once I started exploring the Android app. It's fast, looks gorgeous, and has most of the features I want from a portable music app. It breezes through tens of thousands of tracks in my Library without a hitch. It also has pretty good feature parity with Apple devices, sometimes even getting new features like AutoMix first due to not being tied to iOS and macOS release cycles.

<!-- Although there are some limitations, such as not being able to create new _Smart Playlists_ from the app, it does at least support viewing and playing them. **Smart Playlists** are Apple Music's way of bridging the gap between a curated Library of music (the old-school iTunes kind) and playlists, allowing you to automatically populate songs from your library into a playlist matching a set criteria you provide. Want a playlist of your favorite Hip-hop and RnB music released between 2000 and 2005, you can do that. -->

## Bring your own music

Apple Music's roots in iTunes and their focus on music ownership serves users with existing digital collections very well. From any desktop device (Windows or Mac), you can upload local files to your Apple Music account and have these available in your Library. This is an excellent answer to Spotify's somewhat lackluster 'Local Files' feature, which is an opt-in feature and requires at least one computer to have a copy of the files on the same network for others to sync from.

Unfortunately, the import process for Apple Music is not perfect either

{% alert(warning=true) %}
From this point on, the post will turn into a bit of a trouble-shooting guide.
{% end %}

### Alac of supported formats

Despite being able to import local music in a variety of popular formats including MP3, **FLAC is not supported for imports**. This is unusual given support for their own, equivalent lossless ALAC format and others like WAV. In any case, I got around this by using [MediaHuman Audio Converter](https://www.mediahuman.com/audio-converter/), which thankfully supports both Windows and Mac, to quickly convert 50GB+ of FLACs to ALAC. You can also do this with `ffmpeg` directly, but I never figured out all the flags needed to preserve directory structures and metadata along the way.

Once converted, it was time to import everthing.

### Importing a large collection of physical rips

I started with trying to import my music from Windows, as my MacBook Air doesn't have enough storage to hold all my ripped physical media at once.

On Windows, Apple Music uses your local user's _Music_ folder to store your library data, cache, downloaded tracks, and imported music (if you choose to copy imported files). There is a handy option in the settings which allows you to change this:

<!-- Screenshot -->

**This setting does not (entirely) work.** While some dimensions of Apple Music data respects this location, the Apple Music Windows App still stores some data in the default location (your user's _Music_ folder). This is a problem if you backup your Music folder to something like OneDrive, which many users will do. The Apple Music library data consists of a few DB files, and a number of folders and files _for every song you playlist/store in your library_ (e.g. metadata and artwork). This quickly adds up to a huge number of files trying to sync and subsequently being locked by Apple Music app during the process.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
It's possible that you could manipulate the default location through editing some preference or registry files, but I decided to bite the bullet and **remove the _Music_ from OneDrive backup management**, instead moving the folder to OneDrive directly and leaving my 'official' user's Music folder empty.

This is one of many behavioural changes that Apple Music will ask of its users that do not follow the yellow brick road to Cupertino.
{% end %}

#### Disappearing music

After importing my playlists and uploading my local music, I discovered two strange issues:

1. Many albums uploaded from my local collection were missing random songs
2. Playlists would occasionally lose tracks or appear to reset to earlier states

I never found the cause of the first issue. Unfortunately, it seems with a large enough set of tracks to upload (from Windows at least), the app will lose track (hah!) of certain songs during the upload/matching process and leave you with partial albums.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
The fix for missing songs in albums was to retry the upload from a totally separate device. It's possible that wiping my local library state and trying to import again could have worked, but numerous attempts at deleting everything from my Library and re-uploading left the same songs missing from albums after multiple attempts.

The only thing that worked was to try and re-upload all my albums again from a Mac, which seemed to fill in the missing gaps.
{% end %}

The issue with missing playlist songs is more insidious.

## Respect the Library

You must respect the Library. Coming from Spotify, it's easy to assume the library is just an arbitrary list of songs you might have "Liked" or added to playlists over the years. In fact, in Apple Music, this little setting makes the behavior feel identical:

![]()

But beware! The Library is not just some arbitrary list, but may be the source of truth for all your music (should you choose to use it). Songs can be added to and removed from playlists without altering your library, **but changes to your Library will affect your playlists!**. From its iTunes roots, this makes more sense in hindsight, but is not something I considered at first.

**If you delete a song from your library, the delete will propagate to any playlists the song is a part of too.**

I had enabled the _auto-add to library_ feature without much thought, but later decided that I wanted to try and keep my Library and playlists separate, with the former used only for 'owned' music. I decided to delete a bunch of songs from my library which were added when updating my playlists, and with it, my playlists were affected too.

### Leaning into the Library

Rather than trying to use the library as a separate storage to my playlists, I've decided to lean in and use the Library to track all music that I want to keep around in some form. On desktop, I can use the powerful Library filters to narrow down lists of albums/artists/songs to just those I've uploaded/own if I wish, and on mobile I can use album searches and smart playlists for more targeted listening.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
Backfilling all of my imported playlists into the library took some time:

1. Select all songs within each playlist
2. Right-click and "Add to Library"
3. Wait...

For whatever reason, it takes a second or so for each song to be added to the library, meaning that I needed to leave my Mac on overnight to process all additions.

Plugged in, I ran `caffeinate -s -i -u` to keep it awake, and left Apple Music in focus to work away.
{% end %}

**Now that I have my full Library imported, it's time to listen to some music**.
