## The good

- Android app
- Lossless (?)s

## The bad

- Library vs Playlists: accidentally wiping out your music collection
- Bring your own tracks: some of them, anyway
- Spotify Connect -> Airplay?
  - No Linux player (Cider has... problems)
  - Chromecast servers are non-existent?
  - Airplay 1 vs. 2, bitrate
  - Shairport-sync <3
- No recording allowed (except if you're on Android, then go ahead)
- Lossless
  - Android resamples, Windows client doesn't use lossless
- Last.fm and scrobbling
