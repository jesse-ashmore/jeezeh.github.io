**In this entry, I reflect on what music listening and curation means to me, and journal my experiences with moving from Spotify to Apple Music**, documenting every sharp edge, incompatibility, and workaround I've discovered on the way.

## How I listen

My listening habits are regular by most standards; commuting, exercising, and working all happen to a mostly passive background soundtrack across devices like my Android phone, Windows PC, and MacBooks (work and personal). At home, most evenings involve some sort of active listening through a system I've built up over the years:

- Wharfedale Evo 4.2 ('bookshelf' speakers; they do not fit on a bookshelf)
- Audiolab a6000 (amplifier)
- MiniDSP Flex (room correction for all inputs)
- Shanling CR60 (CD Player, Transport, and Ripper)
- HP Elitedesk 800 G3 Mini (home server running Ubuntu for streaming)

<!-- TODO: Diagram -->

The home server might be a surprise here, but why pay hundreds for a dedicated network streamer when I already own a server that could _theoretically_ do the same thing. More on this later.

### Collection and curation

Music, and its collection and curation, has been a fundamental constant in my life. In my early childhood, curation took the form of mixtapes created from live radio recordings. In my tweens, I used my [daily allowance of 50MB of internet for only €1 (!)](https://web.archive.org/web/20100410163535/http://www.vodafone.ie/vlive/internetmobile) to download as many 128Kbps MP3s as I could and burn them to CDs. Since then, I've built a yearly collection of favourites in my `Starred YYYY` playlists — grandfathered from Spotify's "Starred" songs collection — and more recently began categorizing these into their own tag/vibe-based playlists.

It's a crime that music tagging is not the default way to build and collect music. Imagine if you could tag a song like `favourite`, `workout`, `great bassline`, etc. and build playlists and queues based on combinations of these!
</aside>

Music curation and discovery is still important to me, but the way I listen has been slowly changing. Over this last year, I've found myself with a growing collection of physical media, enjoying a more intentional approach to listening and collecting. Playlists are still the backbone of most of my listening and discovery, but I've started to rediscover the joy in picking a single album (physical or digital) and listening from start to end. This was common as a child when my collection overwhelmingly comprised label-released CDs, but my obsession with playlisting born from the crazed media consumption of my teenage years won out in the long run.

From a curation perspective, Spotify is great for me. Over the years, my weekly ritual of funneling Discover Weekly + Release Radar favourites into various playlists organized by year, genre, vibes, and activities has left me with a rich and eclectic mix of music for all occasions. But Spotify is a playlist-first platform, and today as I reflect on what the _process of music listening means to me_, I find myself increasingly alienated by Spotify's pursuit of the algorithmic experience over a self-directed one. Recommended playlists, daily mixes, AI DJs, and more all fight for my attention, trying to pull me away from control and organization, and towards an endless stream and commodification of beats and vibes.

Something had to give. My Spotify Family Plan was nearing expiry, and given my recent shift in music habits along with mounting negative sentiment around the platform (low pay-outs, artists pulling their music, CEO investments, AI-heavy product direction), I decided it was time to look for an alternative.

## Finding an alternative to Spotify

These days, we are not poor for music streaming platforms, but there are compromises with each. I previously tried Tidal and Deezer, and found them fine, but besides offering lossless streaming in the earlier days I didn't feel like they were distinguished enough from Spotify to pull me away at the time. YouTube Music would be a good choice, especially as I watch a lot of YouTube, but tying more of world into the Google ecosystem seemed like a bad idea. Amazon Music seems promising too, but I've personally heard mixed reports on it as a platform so decided not to try it yet.

I finally landed on two platforms I was interested in: **Apple Music** — which a friend had recently migrated to from Spotify and was raving about — and **Qobuz**.

### Queue-buzz? Co-booze? Qobuz!

Qobuz is interesting: branded as an audiophile streaming platform that promotes music ownership as a first-class citizen, I signed up for the trial. Things were good, until I found it lacked playlist folders. I have a lot of playlists, and organizing them by category is important to me, so having to settle for all playlists sitting in an endless list felt like a difficult pill to swallow. [Until recently](https://community.qobuz.com/press-en/qobuz-unveils-its-new-discover-page), Qobuz also lacked in the discovery department, with no clear analogy to Spotify's Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists. These two main inconveniences were enough to push me away from Qobuz _for the time being_.

In hindsight, and with the recently-added "Release watch" feature, my frustrations with Qobuz would **pale in comparison** to what Apple Music had in store for me. Before we move onto Apple Music, I do want to highlight Qobuz's potential to be a top-tier platform. The app experience was robust, lossless playback as a priority, inclusion of a duo plan for couples, and the best royalty rates for artists out of any other platform make Qobuz stand out as a strong contender, and something I will return to if Apple Music fails to win me over in the next few months.

# Apple Music

Feeling a little disheartened from my initial Qobuz experience, I decided to research Apple Music. For whatever reason, I had assumed Apple Music was only available as a MacOS and iOS app, so I was was shocked to find that not only had they released a fresh Apple Music app for Windows, they also have an Android App — **a very good one at that**.

With the 3 month trial that came with my MacBook Air, I decided there was little to lose by trying out Apple Music. Fortunately, my time and sanity are worthless.

## A great first impression

### The Android App

As mentioned, **the Android app is surprisingly good**. It's fast, looks gorgeous, and has most of the features I want from a portable music app. Overall performance is really great here, breezing through tens of thousands of tracks in my Library without a hitch. It also has pretty good feature parity with Apple devices, sometimes even getting new features like AutoMix first due to not being tied to iOS and macOS release cycles.

Although there are some limitations, such as not being able to create new _Smart Playlists_ from the app, it does at least support viewing and playing them.

**Smart Playlists** are Apple Music's way of bridging the gap between a curated Library of music (the old-school iTunes kind) and playlists, allowing you to automatically populate songs from your library into a playlist matching a set criteria you provide. Want a playlist of your favorite Hip-hop and RnB music released between 2000 and 2005, you can do that.

But how do you get to have such a massive library as a new Apple Music convert?

### The Library

Apple is gracious enough to provide free access to Songshift, a playlist-import service, for users moving to Apple Music. This quickly and efficiently moved over all my playlists, some of which had thousands of songs, with an impressive match rate. This was a great starting point, as I could bring over everything I had in Spotify. It didn't copy my folder structure, but **thankfully Apple Music supports playlist folders**, so it wa just a few minutes of manual effort to get back to the same point I left from with Spotify.

## Bring your own music

Apple Music's roots in iTunes, and their focus on music ownership, serves users with existing digital collections very well. From any desktop device (Windows or Mac), you can upload local files to your Apple Music account and have these available in your Library. This Excellent answer to Spotify's somewhat lackluster 'Local Files' feature, which requires you handle moving music across devices in your own way.

However, this is where I encountered my first obstacle in a string of many.

{% alert(warning=true) %}
From this point on, the post will turn into a bit of a trouble-shooting guide.
{% end %}

### ...as long as it's not FLAC

Unfortunately, despite being able to import local music in a variety of popular formats including MP3, **FLAC is not supported for imports**. This is unusual given their own, equivalent lossless ALAC format, and support for lossless WAV imports. In any case, I got around this by using [MediaHuman Audio Converter](https://www.mediahuman.com/audio-converter/), which thankfully supports both Windows and Mac, to quickly convert 50GB+ of FLACs to ALAC. Importing them was the next major hurdle.

### Importing a large collection of physical rips

I started with trying to import my music from Windows, as my MacBook Air doesn't have enough storage to hold all my ripped physical media at once.

On Windows, Apple Music uses your local user's _Music_ folder to store your library data, cache, downloaded tracks, and imported music (if you choose to copy imported files). There is a handy option in the settings which allows you to change this:

<!-- Screenshot -->

**This setting does not (entirely) work.** While some dimensions of Apple Music data respects this location, the Apple Music Windows App still stores some data in the default location (your user's _Music_ folder). This is a problem if you backup your Music folder to something like OneDrive, which many users will do. The Apple Music library data consists of a few DB files, and a number of folders and files _for every song you playlist/store in your library_ (e.g. metadata and artwork). This quickly adds up to a huge number of files trying to sync and subsequently being locked by Apple Music app during the process.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
It's possible that you could manipulate the default location through editing some preference or registry files, but I decided to bite the bullet and **remove the _Music_ from OneDrive backup management**, instead moving the folder to OneDrive directly and leaving my 'official' user's Music folder empty.

This is one of many behavioural changes that Apple Music will ask of its users that do not follow the yellow brick road to Cupertino.

#### Disappearing music

After importing my playlists and uploading my local music, I discovered two strange issues:

1. Many albums uploaded from my local collection were missing random songs
2. Playlists would occasionally lose tracks or appear to reset to earlier states

I never found the cause of the first issue. Unfortunately, it seems with a large enough set of tracks to upload (from Windows at least), the app will lose track (hah!) of certain songs during the upload/matching process and leave you with partial albums.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
The fix for missing songs in albums was to retry the upload from a totally separate device. It's possible that wiping my local library state and trying to import again could have worked, but numerous attempts at deleting everything from my Library and re-uploading left the same songs missing from albums after multiple attempts.

The only thing that worked was to try and re-upload all my albums again from a Mac, which seemed to fill in the missing gaps.
{% end %}

The issue with missing playlist songs is more insidious.

## Respect the Library

You must respect the Library. Coming from Spotify, it's easy to assume the library is just an arbitrary list of songs you might have "Liked" or added to playlists over the years. In fact, in Apple Music, this little setting makes the behavior feel identical:

![]()

But beware! The Library is not just some arbitrary list, but may be the source of truth for all your music (should you choose to use it). Songs can be added to and removed from playlists without altering your library, **but changes to your Library will affect your playlists!**. From its iTunes roots, this makes more sense in hindsight, but is not something I considered at first.

**If you delete a song from your library, the delete will propagate to any playlists the song is a part of too.**

I had enabled the _auto-add to library_ feature without much thought, but later decided that I wanted to try and keep my Library and playlists separate, with the former used only for 'owned' music. I decided to delete a bunch of songs from my library which were added when updating my playlists, and with it, my playlists were affected too.

### Leaning into the Library

Rather than trying to use the library as a separate storage to my playlists, I've decided to lean in and use the Library to track all music that I want to keep around in some form. On desktop, I can use the powerful Library filters to narrow down lists of albums/artists/songs to just those I've uploaded/own if I wish, and on mobile I can use album searches and smart playlists for more targeted listening.

{% alert(tip=true) %}
Backfilling all of my imported playlists into the library took some time:

1. Select all songs within each playlist
2. Right-click and "Add to Library"
3. Wait...

For whatever reason, it takes a second or so for each song to be added to the library, meaning that I needed to leave my Mac on overnight to process all additions.

Plugged in, I ran `caffeinate -s -i -u` to keep it awake, and left Apple Music in focus to work away.
{% end %}

**Now that I have my full Library imported, it's time to listen to some music**.
