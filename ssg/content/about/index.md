Hi, my name is Jesse!

I'm a Software Engineer at Amazon Dublin, working on a high-volume data lake implementation, real-time event streaming, and graph databases to help our teams meet Amazon's high bar for resiliency. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-ashmore-2597b5130/) for up-to-date job information and experience.

Outside of work, I'm healthily obsessed with tech, music, languages and all things
creative; you can see examples of these in my various portfolios. I've enjoyed spending my time on [side-projects](https://github.com/jesse-ashmore/) like _[React Rail](https://trains.jesse.ie/?)_ — my version of a live timetable for Irish Rail — and _[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)_ (my solutions [here](https://github.com/jesse-ashmore/advent-of-code)) — a brilliantly festive month-long programming challenge by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).
